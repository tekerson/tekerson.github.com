    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a keyboard line junky and a Vim user, this is something I've been meaning to do for a long time. I mean, who actually uses Caps lock anyway? Every time I've had a look, the process has appeared to involve installation of third party software and in general seemed like too much effort. It turns out, if you only want to remap meta-keys (caps lock, alt, ctrl and command) you can do that easily through the OSX System Preferences.</p>

<p>In "Apple Menu" (Top Left), "System Preferences", "Keyboard". On the "Keyboard" Tab (not "Keyboard Shortcuts"), there is a "Modifier Keys" button, which opens a dialog and provides a simple interface to remap (or disable) your modifier keys.</p>

<p>I wish I'd realised sooner that it was so simple, now to re-train my hands and free that poor little finger from its curled up hell.</p>
